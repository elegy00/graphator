## Designing software

- YAGNI. The best code is no code. Don't add features we don't need right now.
- When it doesn't conflict with YAGNI, architect for extensibility and flexibility.


## Test Driven Development  (TDD)
 
- FOR EVERY NEW FEATURE OR BUGFIX, YOU MUST follow Test Driven Development :
    1. Write a failing test that correctly validates the desired functionality
    2. Run the test to confirm it fails as expected
    3. Write ONLY enough code to make the failing test pass
    4. Run the test to confirm success
    5. Refactor if needed while keeping tests green

## Writing code

- When submitting work, verify that you have FOLLOWED ALL RULES. (See Rule #1)
- YOU MUST make the SMALLEST reasonable changes to achieve the desired outcome.
- We STRONGLY prefer simple, clean, maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones. Readability and maintainability are PRIMARY CONCERNS, even at the cost of conciseness or performance.
- YOU MUST WORK HARD to reduce code duplication, even if the refactoring takes extra effort.
- YOU MUST NEVER throw away or rewrite implementations without EXPLICIT permission. If you're considering this, YOU MUST STOP and ask first.
- YOU MUST get Jesse's explicit approval before implementing ANY backward compatibility.
- YOU MUST MATCH the style and formatting of surrounding code, even if it differs from standard style guides. Consistency within a file trumps external standards.
- YOU MUST NOT manually change whitespace that does not affect execution or output. Otherwise, use a formatting tool.
- Fix broken things immediately when you find them. Don't ask permission to fix bugs.



## Naming

  - Names MUST tell what code does, not how it's implemented or its history
  - When changing code, never document the old behavior or the behavior change
  - NEVER use implementation details in names (e.g., "ZodValidator", "MCPWrapper", "JSONParser")
  - NEVER use temporal/historical context in names (e.g., "NewAPI", "LegacyHandler", "UnifiedTool", "ImprovedInterface", "EnhancedParser")
  - NEVER use pattern names unless they add clarity (e.g., prefer "Tool" over "ToolFactory")

  Good names tell a story about the domain:
  - `Tool` not `AbstractToolInterface`
  - `RemoteTool` not `MCPToolWrapper`
  - `Registry` not `ToolRegistryManager`
  - `execute()` not `executeToolWithValidation()`

## Code Comments

 - NEVER add comments explaining that something is "improved", "better", "new", "enhanced", or referencing what it used to be
 - NEVER add instructional comments telling developers what to do ("copy this pattern", "use this instead")
 - Comments should explain WHAT the code does or WHY it exists, not how it's better than something else
 - If you're refactoring, remove old comments - don't add new ones explaining the refactoring
 - YOU MUST NEVER remove code comments unless you can PROVE they are actively false. Comments are important documentation and must be preserved.
 - YOU MUST NEVER add comments about what used to be there or how something has changed. 
 - YOU MUST NEVER refer to temporal context in comments (like "recently refactored" "moved") or code. Comments should be evergreen and describe the code as it is. If you name something "new" or "enhanced" or "improved", you've probably made a mistake and MUST STOP and ask me what to do.
 - All code files MUST start with a brief 2-line comment explaining what the file does. Each line MUST start with "ABOUTME: " to make them easily greppable.

  Examples:
  // BAD: This uses Zod for validation instead of manual checking
  // BAD: Refactored from the old validation system
  // BAD: Wrapper around MCP tool protocol
  // GOOD: Executes tools with validated arguments

  If you catch yourself writing "new", "old", "legacy", "wrapper", "unified", or implementation details in names or comments, STOP and find a better name that describes the thing's
  actual purpose.

## Documentation
 - Only document things that are not clear from the code
 - Don't replicate code into the documentations
 
## Testing

- ALL TEST FAILURES ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY, even if they're not your fault. The Broken Windows theory is real.
- Never delete a test because it's failing. Instead, raise the issue with Jesse. 
- Tests MUST comprehensively cover ALL functionality. 
- YOU MUST NEVER write tests that "test" mocked behavior. If you notice tests that test mocked behavior instead of real logic, you MUST stop and warn Jesse about them.
- YOU MUST NEVER implement mocks in end to end tests. We always use real data and real APIs.
- YOU MUST NEVER ignore system or test output - logs and messages often contain CRITICAL information.
- Test output MUST BE PRISTINE TO PASS. If logs are expected to contain errors, these MUST be captured and tested. If a test is intentionally triggering an error, we *must* capture and validate that the error output is as we expect


## Issue tracking

- You MUST use your TodoWrite tool to keep track of what you're doing 
- You MUST NEVER discard tasks from your TodoWrite todo list without Jesse's explicit approval

## Systematic Debugging Process

YOU MUST ALWAYS find the root cause of any issue you are debugging
YOU MUST NEVER fix a symptom or add a workaround instead of finding a root cause, even if it is faster or I seem like I'm in a hurry.

YOU MUST follow this debugging framework for ANY technical issue:

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation (BEFORE attempting fixes)
- **Read Error Messages Carefully**: Don't skip past errors or warnings - they often contain the exact solution
- **Reproduce Consistently**: Ensure you can reliably reproduce the issue before investigating
- **Check Recent Changes**: What changed that could have caused this? Git diff, recent commits, etc.

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis
- **Find Working Examples**: Locate similar working code in the same codebase
- **Compare Against References**: If implementing a pattern, read the reference implementation completely
- **Identify Differences**: What's different between working and broken code?
- **Understand Dependencies**: What other components/settings does this pattern require?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing
1. **Form Single Hypothesis**: What do you think is the root cause? State it clearly
2. **Test Minimally**: Make the smallest possible change to test your hypothesis
3. **Verify Before Continuing**: Did your test work? If not, form new hypothesis - don't add more fixes
4. **When You Don't Know**: Say "I don't understand X" rather than pretending to know

### Phase 4: Implementation Rules
- ALWAYS have the simplest possible failing test case. If there's no test framework, it's ok to write a one-off test script.
- NEVER add multiple fixes at once
- NEVER claim to implement a pattern without reading it completely first
- ALWAYS test after each change
- IF your first fix doesn't work, STOP and re-analyze rather than adding more fixes

## Learning and Memory Management

- YOU MUST use the journal tool frequently to capture technical insights, failed approaches, and user preferences
- Before starting complex tasks, search the journal for relevant past experiences and lessons learned
- Document architectural decisions and their outcomes for future reference
- Track patterns in user feedback to improve collaboration over time
- When you notice something that should be fixed but is unrelated to your current task, document it in your journal rather than fixing it immediately
